# Enhancing Photogrammetric Reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting-Based Novel Views

This project investigates whether novel views generated using **Gaussian Splatting**, a neural rendering technique, can be used to improve traditional **photogrammetric 3D reconstruction**.

We use a two-part approach:

### ðŸ“Œ Part A: Baseline Model and Splatting Evaluation
- A set of original photographs (10â€“15 images) was used to generate a 3D mesh using **Agisoft Metashape**.
- **Gaussian Splatting** was applied to the same dataset to synthesize novel views.
- The synthetic images were compared with original images using **PSNR** and **SSIM** metrics to evaluate rendering quality.

### ðŸ“Œ Part B: Gaussian-Augmented Photogrammetry
- 10 novel images rendered by Gaussian Splatting were added to the original set.
- A fresh photogrammetric model was built using the **25-image dataset**.
- Quantitative comparison (vertices, faces, bounding box volume) and qualitative evaluation showed improvements in the final reconstruction.

### âœ… Conclusion

This project demonstrates that neural rendering outputs like those from **Gaussian Splatting** can meaningfully augment photogrammetric datasets and improve 3D reconstruction quality. This hybrid approach could be useful for applications in digital heritage, robotics, or simulation where complete 3D models are crucial.
